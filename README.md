# Water-drinking-timer
This is a water drinking timer. But its a bit more than that. 
---
This timer will run an annoying alarm for 5 minutes after the end of every hour. You can give any input which is writing anything and pressing enter. This will give you how many minutes are left for that 1 hour to finish.
After the hour finishes there is a time of 5 minutes during which you can type anything and press enter to which the program will assume that you have drunk the water and will
take away your due amount of water to 1. The due amount of water gets added by 1 everytime you dont respond during that 5 mins timer. If you have for example 3 glasses left to drink which means that you have not input anything during that 5 minutes. The next time during that 5 minute if you give input, the program will automatically assume that you have drunk the water.
